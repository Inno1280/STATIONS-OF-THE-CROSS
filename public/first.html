            Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, “if you release this man, you are not Caesar’s friend;
            everyone who makes himself a king sets himself against Caesar.” When Pilate heard these words, he brought
            Jesus out and said to the Jews “Here is your king!” They cried out away with him, away with him, crucify
            him!” Pilate said to them, “shall I crucify your king?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but
            Caesar!” Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.

            In Pilate’s hands, my friend, I see my father’s will it is true that Pilate is unjust but he is the lawful
            governor and he has power over me; and so the son of God obeys a son of man if I will bow to Pilate’s rule,
            because this is my Father’s will can you refuse obedience to those whom I have placed over you?
