        <p class="reading">
            By oppression and judgement, he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut
            out
            of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people. And they made his grave with the
            wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violent action and there was no deceit in
            his mouth. Yet it was the will of the Lord to bruise him; he has put him to grief; when he makes himself an
            offering for sin, he shall see his offspring, he shall prolong his days; the will of the Lord shall prosper
            in his hand.

        <p class="word-of-christ">
            I have fallen down again completely drained of strength my body cannot move and yet my will is mine and so
            is yours. My child, this one thing is certain, your body may be broken but no force on earth and none in
            hell can take away your will, your will is yours.

        <p class="word-of-man">
            My Lord, after a moment’s rest, you took off again and staggered on. I can do the same because my will is
            mine. When all my strength is gone and guilt and self-reproach press me to earth and seem to hold me fast,
            when I am pressed down by the consideration that I am of a fallen race, protect me from the sin of judas;
            save me from despair Lord, never let me feel that any sin of mine is greater than your love. No matter what
            my past has been, I can begin anew.
