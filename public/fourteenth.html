            They took the Body of Jesus, and bound it in linen clothes with the spices, as is the burial customs of the
            Jews. Now, in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, where no
            one
            had ever been laid. So because of the Jewish day of preparation, as the tomb was close at hand, they laid
            Jesus there.

            Lord Jesus, it is hard to be your apostle the demands are great. You have completed your work, what is left
            is mine, that of my fellowmen that of your church. The teachings you could not impart, let me impart. The
            sufferings you could not bear, let me bear. The work of love you could not do in you short life on earth.
            Let me do- all through you for you are all in all.
