            These fourteen steps you are about to walk, you do not take alone. I am with you, we are truly one.
            And therefore my way of the Cross, two thousand years ago, and your own way now are also one.
            Yet there is a difference; my life was incomplete until I crowned it with my death.
            Your fourteen steps will not be complete until you crown it with your own life.

        <p class="word-of-man">
            My Lord Jesus Christ, you walked this road of suffering even to your death. You did this for me. and yet I
            have so often failed to love of you by my sins. Now I want to love you with all my heart and to turn away
            from everything that offends you. Pardon me my God. Allow me to follow you on this journey. You went out to
            die for love of me. give me the courage and the faith to be able to die with love of you whenever the right
            time comes. I want to live and die always united to you. Amen
