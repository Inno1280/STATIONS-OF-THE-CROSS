            Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and
            afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the
            chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed. All we, like sheep, have gone astray;
            we have turned, everyone to his own way; and the lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
