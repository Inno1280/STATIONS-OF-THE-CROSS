        <p class="reading">
            And there followed him a great multitude of people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus
            turning to them said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your
            children. For behold, the days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that
            never bore, and the breasts that never gave suck’. Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on
            us’; to the hills cover us’. For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen, when it is dry?

            How often have I longed to gather my children into one communion with me, but they refused? And now these
            women weep for me. I mourn for them and their sorrows that will come. My dear child, you can really be more
            gentle, you too can be kind.

            Lord, teach me, help me to learn, when I would snap at those who hurt me with their ridicule, those who
            misunderstand me, those whom I think hinder my progress with some misguided helpfulness; those who intrude
            upon my privacy, those who restrict my freedom and liberty. Then help me curb my tongue, may gentleness
            become my cloak.
