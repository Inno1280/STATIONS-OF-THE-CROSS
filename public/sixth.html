            Who has believed what we have heard? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? For he grew up
            before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; he had no form or comeliness that we
            should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men; a man of
            sorrows, and acquainted with grief, and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised and we
            esteemed him not.

            Can you be brave enough to wipe my bloody face? “where is your face?” you may ask me. and I will answer;
            “everywhere: at home whenever eyes fill up with tears at work when tensions rise in the classroom, on
            playgrounds, in the remote and dirty villages, the court, the hospitals, the jails, wherever suffering
            exists, my face is there and there I look for you to wipe away my blood and tears.

            Lord, this is hard; it needs courage and self sacrifice; it is an uncomfortable job but I will not run away
            from it; come and act in me and not in me alone – in all men, so that we may reveal not your bloody but your
            glorious face on earth.
